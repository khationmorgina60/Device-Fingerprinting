# Device Fingerprinting: How It Works and Why It Matters

## What Is Device Fingerprinting?

Device fingerprinting is a powerful tool for fraud prevention and user identification. It collects detailed information about user devices and analyzes it to uncover patterns, detect fraud, and improve decision-making processes. SEON integrates device fingerprinting seamlessly into platforms to provide actionable insights and robust fraud detection.

## Key Parameters Collected

SEON gathers a range of parameters to uniquely identify devices and detect fraudulent behavior:

- **Cookie Hash**: Identifies browser sessions, helping detect users sharing the same browser or clearing cookies frequently.
- **Browser Hash**: Tracks browser details to spot patterns in behavior or device usage.
- **Device Hash**: Collects information about the device (e.g., OS, GPU, screen resolution) to identify unique setups.

These parameters allow businesses to find connections between users, detect suspicious behavior, and strengthen fraud prevention.
