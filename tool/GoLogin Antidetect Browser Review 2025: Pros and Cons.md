## Areas Where GoLogin Falls Short

While GoLogin offers several attractive features, there are notable areas for improvement:

Compared to competitors, GoLogin’s anti-fingerprinting measures are basic. On certain devices, users are restricted to fingerprints matching their actual hardware, reducing antidetection effectiveness.

### 2. **Proxy Integration Challenges**
GoLogin’s proxy pool is relatively small (10,000 IPs across 78 countries), increasing the risk of IP reuse and detection. Advanced proxy features like sticky IP sessions are absent.

### 3. **User Experience Issues**
The minimalist interface can be confusing for new users, with features hidden in submenus. Additionally, the setup process is not user-friendly, with downloads beginning before account creation.

### 4. **Performance on Lower-End Devices**
Users report that GoLogin struggles to manage multiple profiles efficiently on less powerful hardware. This can hinder productivity for those working with resource-intensive setups.

## Should You Choose GoLogin in 2024?

### **The Verdict**

GoLogin is a promising antidetect browser with features that appeal to budget-conscious users and teams managing multiple accounts. However, its limitations in fingerprinting technology, proxy integration, and user experience make it less ideal for advanced or high-stakes use cases.

For beginners or those with basic anonymity needs, GoLogin is a solid starting point. However, professionals requiring advanced features and robust anti-fingerprinting may want to explore more mature solutions like Multilogin.

As GoLogin continues to evolve, it remains an affordable and functional option for many users, but with room for growth in key areas.
