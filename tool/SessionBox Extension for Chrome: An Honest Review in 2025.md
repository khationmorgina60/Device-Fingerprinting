## SessionBox: First Impressions

### Website and App Usability

The SessionBox website looks modern but lacks clarity about how the app works. Although we set up an account and accessed the free trial without issues, the platform would benefit from a Google authentication login for easier access. SessionBox claims to handle 100+ Facebook profiles seamlessly, a bold assertion given Facebook’s strict anti-bot measures.

### Installation Process

Initially developed as a Chrome Web Store extension for isolating browser tabs, SessionBox has expanded to include **SessionBox One**, a new Chrome extension paired with a desktop application. Together, they aim to provide isolated browsing sessions through both tabs in Chrome and profiles in their proprietary browser, Workstation.

### Key Features at a Glance:

- **Session Isolation**: Multi-login capabilities within a single browser.
- **Legacy Extension**: Outdated interface but still functional.
- **Workstation Browser**: A standalone antidetect browser for enhanced security.

## Legacy Extension: A Closer Look

The older SessionBox Chrome extension uses color-coded tabs to differentiate sessions. While the concept is innovative, the execution is clunky, and tabs can easily become visually overwhelming. Additionally, the extension’s proxy setup interface feels unintuitive, and basic fingerprinting protection is absent. 

### Performance in Basic Tests

We tested the extension on **Pixelscan.net** and **Iphey.com**. Unfortunately, the legacy extension failed to mask our fingerprint and appeared outdated compared to modern antidetect browsers.

## New SessionBox One Extension

The updated SessionBox One extension provides a more modern interface. However, it still relies on color-coded tabs, which limits usability when managing more than 20 profiles. For full functionality, users must download the **Workstation desktop browser**, which adds another layer of complexity. Synchronization between the extension and browser remains inconsistent, and tabs often fail to retain session states after closing.

---

## SessionBox Workstation Browser

The Workstation browser is promoted as an **antidetect browser**, but it functions more like a lightweight Chromium browser with minimal features. While it offers options like proxy auto-assign and basic automation, its fingerprinting protection falls short in tests. Both the browser and extension failed to pass fingerprint checks on Pixelscan.net.
